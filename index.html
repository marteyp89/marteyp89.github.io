        <h3>My background</h3>
        <p>I'm an aspiring web developer who has a keen interest in web technologies.
          I have always been into computers and originally studied IT systems support.
It is great to be able to think of an idea and then build it from the beginning to the end.
I have been working in the construction industry for the last 4 years.
I had no prior experience in construction but became one of our most productive engineers within months.
Learning how to code has been an amazing experience so far. I want to keep improving and growing my skills. <a class="cv_link" href="martin_cv.html">Link to full CV HERE</a></p>
